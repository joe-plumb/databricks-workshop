# Azure Databricks Workshop
## Overview
This workshop content can be used to induct yourself or a team into Spark fundamentals using Azure Databricks, machine learning concepts, and streaming data systems. The labs are collated from a variety of sources and lead the attendees through the process of using notebooks to execute code, the ML training process, and ingesting and processing streaming data using Apache Spark.

## Setup
The workshop as is expects attendees to be working in their own subscriptions, and includes slide instructions to create an Azure Databricks workspace and clone the content they will need into their own environment. This could of course be edited so that users collaborate in one workspace.
Attendees will need:
- Laptop
- Microsoft ID and Azure Subscription

For the streaming part of the workshop, users will need Twitter application credentials which can be requested from the [Twitter Developer site](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html). This can either be set as a pre-requisite for each attendee (usually takes ~24 hours to be processed), or the team delivering the workshop can apply for credentials and share these with the attendees on the day.
